<h2>Shortyz 2.1.17</h2>

<p>Wow, so that last one had some problems. First thing: I would just like to ask everyone:
<br /><br /><b>If you are having problems, <a href="mailto:kebernet@gmail.com">email</a> me!</b><br /><br />
I don't own every phone in the world. Really just the one. If there is a problem like this
one, your comments in the Market don't help me fix it at all. If you want to drop your rating
of the app, feel free, but if you want the problem fixed, scroll down and hit that "Developer Email"
button. :P</p>

<p>Next, a bit of explanation: The problem here is that it seems that some phones from Moto and 
Samsung, with certain versions of Android don't include the full set of character encodings
from Java. Specifically, MacRoman (the Mac OS western alphabet), which is used for some of 
the new puzzle sources. This was causing all kinds of havoc. The short version is this:
<ul><li>If you are on some Samsung or Moto phones, you will not see non-English characters
properly on some of the new puzzles</li></ul></p>

<p>They should, however, now work most of the time. Again, I am sorry to anyone who had crash
issues, and I am sorry for spamming everyone else who wasn't with updates. This was just 
something that testing in the emulators wouldn't catch and didn't show up on my phone.</p>


<h3>Previously: 2.1.12</h3>

<p>First of all, I would like to officially welcome Jeff Davidson to the "team." He has made a number of big
contributions to this release:

<ul>
   <li>Improved movement semantics, especially when you have skip filled and show errors on.</li>
   <li>New sources, included the first non-AcrossLite format puzzles: Sheffer, Joseph Crosswords, 
   Universal Crossword, USA Today, WaPo Sunday (other days the same as the Houston Chronicle), Newsday,
   Jonesin' Crosswords, Premier Crosswords and the LA Times Sunday Calendar.</li>
   <li>Download dialog now supports selecting a single puzzle source if you want.</li>
   <li>Puzzles with circled clues (that are properly encoded) will show the circles on the playboard.
   Please note: puzzles you have previously downloaded won't work unless you delete and redownload. 
   New puzzles going forward should work fine, though.</li>
   <li>Settings for puzzle sources re-orged.</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>Wow. I feel like a wuss now. Thanks so much. In other news...
<ul>
   <li>New rendering code. Mostly you shouldn't notice it, but the Clues display and the Board now share 
   rendering code, so the strange positioning on the Clues display is gone and show errors works propery.</li>
   <li>Pinch zoom for Froyo (Android 2.2) is full on. Will properly center around the pinch, not the 0,0 position. Also the 
   snap from re-rending now more closely matches the sizing of the scaled image. Also limits the scale range
   so you shouldn't be able to hose the app by zooming to large or too small.</li>
   <li>Lots of small bug fixes</li>
</ul></p>

<p>We have also both made a pass at the "Ensure Visible" code. I think it is much improved now but there will be
a few differences. If you nav off the lower edge of the screen, you will snap down the a full screen to the new
cursor position. When you nav off screen into a new word, you will get visibility on the side of the word your
cursor is closest to -- the beginning or end of the word.</p>

<p>From the "You can't please everyone" Department, Double Tap to toggle between default
zoom and fit to screen is back. This time it is a setting that you can toggle. The 
behavior of "Fit to Screen" in the zoom context menu is unchanged.</p>


<h3>Previously: 2.2.9</h3>

<p>OK, everyone but me seems to hate the double tap scale. Moved Fit to Screen to the Zoom menu
and works like a standard zoom setting now.</p>

<h3>Previously: 2.2.5</h3>
<p>Doin' the quickie dance:
<ul>
	<li>"Use Native Keyboard" pref replaced with "Keyboard Style". Now includes a keyboard with a row of
	arrow keys. If you are on a device without a ball/dpad (read:EVO, Droid<sup>X</sup>) and aren't 
	using the native keyboard, this will come up by default. Might be good for Droid users too.</li>
	<li>File Corruption on Exit: De-normalized IO code for speed. Hopefully this will help with file corruption issues on 
	slower devices. <b>If this is happening to you, simply "Back" out to the list screen before 
	you switch out of the app!</b></li>
	<li>Double tap the playboard to fast-switch between "Fit to Screen" and whatever your normal
	zoom level is.</li>
	<li>Fixed the "Back" button issue coming back into the play screen from settings/clues</li>
	<li>Icon changed to fit the official 
	<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design.html">Android 
	style guide</a>: Little smaller, has drop shadow.</li>
	<li>NYT password masked</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Previously: 2.2.0</h3>
<h4>A Brief Note (release info follows):</h4>
<a name="donations" />
<p>Shortyz is free and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/shortyz">open source</a>. No ads, no whatever. Honestly, I started working on it because
last fall when I switched from the iPhone world to the Android world, there wasn't an app that
would let me do the NYT puzzle easily on the train ride to work. A number of people have asked about 
a paid version. Honestly, a paid version puts me into copyright issues territory, and I really
don't want to get into that. This is not a business, and I don't want to give the appearance 
I am reselling anyone else's property. I don't host or copy the puzzles you download in the app in any way; you 
download them directly from their publicly available sources with the app.  
</p>
<p>
So, I have added a donate button at the top of this screen. Want to buy me a beer? Feel free, 
but don't feel obligated. You won't get anything more or less out of the app than anyone else.
Also, if you feel like spreading the wealth, consider visiting 
<a href="http://inkwellxwords.com/iwxbooks.html">Ink Well</a> and 
<a href="http://www.brendanemmettquigley.com/">Brendan Emmett Quigley's site</a> and buying their 
fine wares.
</p>
<p>End of speech. At any rate. What is up with this version? Lots of stuff!
<ul>
<li>
I have been watching the new Android Market crash report tool. It only reports for version 
2.1+, I believe. However, I think I have gotten all of the "crash to ground" issues in the app worked out now. 
If you see a complete crash (and not a "Wait"), please <a href="mailto:kebernet@gmail.com">email me</a>.
</li>
<li>
Automatic downloads will only be retried once every twelve hours. Yay!
</li>
<li>
Brendan Emmett Quigley's blog scraper is promoted out of experimental. It seems to be working
well.
</li>
<li>
With "Show Errors" on, I now invert the text color on your highlight row, so there is a way to
see incorrect squares without moving the cursor.
</li>
<li>
Some minor changes to the playboard renderer to help with multitouch scaling on Froyo. Not 100% where it
should be, but getting close.
</li>
<li>
The "Search" button, if your device has one, will now skip you to the next clue in the 
same direction as you are currently playing.
</li>
<li>
There is now a confirmation on "Reveal Puzzle."
</li>
<li>
Show Errors and Reveal will be disabled for NYT puzzles that have not updated the answer key.
</li>
<li>
All un-updated NYT puzzles will have their answer key updated on the next download event.
</li>
<li>
NYT Puzzles don't have an answer key have a red progress indicator.
</li>
<li>You also may have noticed in a previous silent version that non-US English characters now
appear (hopefully) correctly in the clues. If you spot a puzzle where they don't, please email me the puzzle
source. This is kind of a guessing game for me, since not all the puzzles seem to be created with
the same characters set.
</li>
<li>There is a new preference option to make the number of characters in a clue appear at the end
of the clue line. This isn't the default because some puzzles include this in the clue, separated
with commas. So "OHGOON" might show as [2,2,2]. I can't synthesize the word breaks (Is that "Oh go on" or "Oh Goon?"), 
but I can show you the total number of characters [6] if you want to see it.
</li>
<li>You can now embiggen the clue text. This is via the "Zoom" context menu (Long touch
the playboard).
</li>
<li>
There are some minor changes to the .shortyz data file format to support future features. 
(I'm working on some cool stuff for Froyo) You shouldn't notice any difference.
</li>
<li>Now waits a moment before showing the busy dialog when rendering the browse view. Some people
have complained about speed, but it hasn't actually changed. I honestly think seeing the busy dialog
just gives that impression. So if I can render the list quickly, I don't show it at all. If this
is actually taking more than a few seconds for you, consider using the "Cleanup" operation to 
move your old and completed puzzles to the archive.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Previously: 2.1.8</h3>
<p>Quick update. Mostly bug fixes. Two noticeable changes:
<ul>
<li>
New look for the puzzle browse screen
</li>
<li>
Show Errors is now persistent.
</li>
<li>
<b>2.1.7 to 2.1.8</b>: Quick fix to make "Show Errors" default to off. 
	This was my mistake.
</li>
</ul>
</p>



<h3>Previously: 2.1.1</h3>

<p>Some updates here most of you won't notice. A few bug fixes. However, if you are running
Froyo (Android 2.2) you now have pinch zoom on the play board and Shortyz will install to external
storage, saving you that whole 100K on your internal storage. :P</p>
<p>There is also a new screen specifically to complain when the SDCard is unavailble. Hopefully
this will reduce support issues for me.</p>


<h3>Previously: 2.1.0</h3>

<p>Sorry if you feel spammed the last few days with updates. I am using the holiday to try
and get to all the feature requests and known bugs, so I am pumping them out. This time, though
moving up a whole minor version number!</p>

<p>Lots and Lots of Changes:
<ul>
	<li>New "Movement Style" Preference. You can set this to one of:
	<ul>
	<li>Next word in line (same as previous versions)</li>
	<li>Stop at end (stops at the end of the word rather than move to a new one automatically)</li>
	<li>Next clue in the same direction (moves you to the next across or down clue in order)</li>
	<li>Next parallel clue (moves you to the next clue in the same direction parallel to the word
	from the last box in the word)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Toggle for Spacebar changing directions or wiping a square.</li>
	<li>Toggle for Enter changing directions or moving to next clue (see above ; this doesn't impact 
	the condensed keyboard at all)</li>
	<li>Added the Chronicle of Higher Education puzzle as a source</li>
	<li>Added the Kegler's Kryptics Archive as a scrape (read the help before you enable it)</li>
	<li>The browse view no longer refreshes when you move back to it, improving performance and preserving
	your place in a list</li>
	<li>Some improvement on stray characters on the keyboard swipe</li>
	<li>A number of small bug fixes</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Special thanks the following people for suggestions/testing for this release (in no particular order):
<ul>
    <li>Brian Christopher</li>
    <li>chemisus</li>
    <li>Alicia Hartman</li>
    <li>Dick Wall</li>
    <li>Brian Gregory</li>
    <li>Katherine Madeira</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Previously: 2.0.30</h3>

<p>Fast update, but this is mostly just bug fixes.
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a crash bug on blank upper left boxes and the clue lie.</li>
 <li>Fixed the chunky scrolling on long clue lists</li>
 <li>For Droid users: You can now make a smooth swipe across the condensed keyboard
     to simulate the DPad when the keyboard is closed.</li>
 <li>Changed the condensed keyboard to be the default. I am satisfied it works well enough.</li>    
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Previously: 2.0.26</h3>

<p>Number of noticeable changes here, mostly just improvements to what is already there. Some 
highlights:
<ul>
	<li>The puzzle list is now grouped and...</li>
	<li>sortable with the new menu item on the browse screen.</li>
	<li>Zoom level on the puzzle now persists as a preference</li>
	<li><b>SWYPE USERS</b> (or anybody): There is now a condensed keyboard available
	within Shortyz. It is smaller than the default Android keyboard so it can be better on
	touch-only phones, and it will get around problems with third party keyboards. You 
	can enable it in the settings by unchecking "Use Native Keyboard".</li>
</ul>

</p>



<h3>Previously: 2.0.22</h3>

<p>At long, long last the first character bug in the clue list view is fixed. Sorry this took
so long, but that was actually a deep bug based on how the Android list view works.</p>

<p>Cryptics! That's right Brits, there is now a cryptics source available. It is in the 
experimental scrapers section. Please read the help there. It is not enabled by default, so you
will need to go to the settings page.</p>

<p>Number of other small bug fixes that only got one or two reports. Which brings me to</p>

<p>Thanks so much to you guys. The Shortyz user base is great to work with. If you are having 
problems or a suggestion, please email me at <a href="mailto:kebernet@gmail.com">kebernet@gmail.com</a>
I can't make any promises, but I will do my best to address your issue/feature request.</p>



<h3>Previously: 2.0.17</h3>

<p>This version includes a number of small changes. There has been an upgrade to the playboard
logic, so you should never end up with a focused empty square again.</p>
<p>Next, there is the new "Web Scraping" downloaders. The first of these is from cruciverbalist
and Shortyz user
<a href="http://brendanemmettquigley.com/">Brendan Emmett Quigley</a>. This feature allows for
the inclusion of puzzles that don't come as part of a regular puzzle feed. See the info in the 
"Settings" screen for more information.</p>
<p>The zoom steps on the board have been changed from 50% to 25%</p>
<p>When "Skip Completed Letters" is on, typing over a completed square will not skip the next
completed square. This should make correcting words easier.</p>
<p>Application options have moved to the bottom of the settings screen, after the puzzle sources</p>
<p>Finally, speaking of experimental, if you would like to try a web based version of Shortyz
you can play on your desktop or laptop, try visiting 
<a href="http://shortyz.kebernet.net">http://shortyz.kebernet.net</a>. This version is still 
under heavy development, but is quite playable right now</a>.</p>



<h3>Previously: 2.0.15</h3>

<p>This is mostly work to address bugs that have been reported. If you are experiencing crashes, please
install <a href="market://search?q=pname:org.l6n.sendlog">SendLog</a> and 
<a href="mailto:kebernet@gmail.com"/>email me</a> your raw log files. This will help me diagnose and 
fix your problems.</p>


<h3>Previously: 2.0.8</h3>
<p>Shortyz has been updated based on some feedback from the user community. Much
of what is new in this version are options for changing the UI behavior under Settings.
 These include:

<ul>
<li>Skill Filled Boxes: Skips over boxes with answers when you enter a new letter.</li>
<li>Scroll To Clue: Scrolls the current clue to the top of the view when in clue mode. This
can make working with the D-Pad/Trackball easier on this screen. (Works like Shortyz 1)</li>
<li>No Download Messages: Prevents a notification from being sent for each new puzzle downloaded.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Other fixes: 
<ul>
<li>"Show Errors" now switches to "Hide Errors" when toggling. </li>
<li>Taping a box in Clues list works, also the scroll position is reset when you move 
from clue to clue, preventing long clues from "breaking" the display.</li>
<li> When "re-downloading" a New York Times puzzle updates the answer key. </li>
<li>Fixed problem of archived puzzles being 
re-downloaded. </li>
<li>Also, work has been done on managing the
on-screen keyboard to make it feel more natural.</li>
</ul>
</p>
