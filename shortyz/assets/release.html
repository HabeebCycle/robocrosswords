<h3>Previously: 2.0.8</h3>
<p>Shortyz has been updated based on some feedback from the user community. Much
of what is new in this version are options for changing the UI behavior under Settings.
 These include:

<ul>
<li>Skill Filled Boxes: Skips over boxes with answers when you enter a new letter.</li>
<li>Scroll To Clue: Scrolls the current clue to the top of the view when in clue mode. This
can make working with the D-Pad/Trackball easier on this screen. (Works like Shortyz 1)</li>
<li>No Download Messages: Prevents a notification from being sent for each new puzzle downloaded.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Other fixes: 
<ul>
<li>"Show Errors" now switches to "Hide Errors" when toggling. </li>
<li>Taping a box in Clues list works, also the scroll position is reset when you move 
from clue to clue, preventing long clues from "breaking" the display.</li>
<li> When "re-downloading" a New York Times puzzle updates the answer key. </li>
<li>Fixed problem of archived puzzles being 
re-downloaded. </li>
<li>Also, work has been done on managing the
on-screen keyboard to make it feel more natural.</li>
</ul>
</p>
