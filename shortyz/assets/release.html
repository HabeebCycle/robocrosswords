<h2>Welcome to Shortyz 2.0.26</h2>

<p>Number of noticeable changes here, mostly just improvements to what is already there. Some 
highlights:
<ul>
	<li>The puzzle list is now grouped and...</li>
	<li>sortable with the new menu item on the browse screen.</li>
	<li>Zoom level on the puzzle now persists as a preference</li>
	<li><b>SWYPE USERS</b> (or anybody): There is now a condensed keyboard available
	within Shortyz. It is smaller than the default Android keyboard so it can be better on
	touch-only phones, and it will get around problems with third party keyboards. You 
	can enable it in the settings by unchecking "Use Native Keyboard".</li>
</ul>

</p>



<h3>Previously Shortyz 2.0.22</h3>

<p>At long, long last the first character bug in the clue list view is fixed. Sorry this took
so long, but that was actually a deep bug based on how the Android list view works.</p>

<p>Cryptics! That's right Brits, there is now a cryptics source available. It is in the 
experimental scrapers section. Please read the help there. It is not enabled by default, so you
will need to go to the settings page.</p>

<p>Number of other small bug fixes that only got one or two reports. Which brings me to</p>

<p>Thanks so much to you guys. The Shortyz user base is great to work with. If you are having 
problems or a suggestion, please email me at <a href="mailto:kebernet@gmail.com">kebernet@gmail.com</a>
I can't make any promises, but I will do my best to address your issue/feature request.</p>



<h3>Previously: 2.0.17</h3>

<p>This version includes a number of small changes. There has been an upgrade to the playboard
logic, so you should never end up with a focused empty square again.</p>
<p>Next, there is the new "Web Scraping" downloaders. The first of these is from cruciverbalist
and Shortyz user
<a href="http://brendanemmettquigley.com/">Brendan Emmett Quigley</a>. This feature allows for
the inclusion of puzzles that don't come as part of a regular puzzle feed. See the info in the 
"Settings" screen for more information.</p>
<p>The zoom steps on the board have been changed from 50% to 25%</p>
<p>When "Skip Completed Letters" is on, typing over a completed square will not skip the next
completed square. This should make correcting words easier.</p>
<p>Application options have moved to the bottom of the settings screen, after the puzzle sources</p>
<p>Finally, speaking of experimental, if you would like to try a web based version of Shortyz
you can play on your desktop or laptop, try visiting 
<a href="http://shortyz.kebernet.net">http://shortyz.kebernet.net</a>. This version is still 
under heavy development, but is quite playable right now</a>.</p>



<h3>Previously: 2.0.15</h3>

<p>This is mostly work to address bugs that have been reported. If you are experiencing crashes, please
install <a href="market://search?q=pname:org.l6n.sendlog">SendLog</a> and 
<a href="mailto:kebernet@gmail.com"/>email me</a> your raw log files. This will help me diagnose and 
fix your problems.</p>


<h3>Previously: 2.0.8</h3>
<p>Shortyz has been updated based on some feedback from the user community. Much
of what is new in this version are options for changing the UI behavior under Settings.
 These include:

<ul>
<li>Skill Filled Boxes: Skips over boxes with answers when you enter a new letter.</li>
<li>Scroll To Clue: Scrolls the current clue to the top of the view when in clue mode. This
can make working with the D-Pad/Trackball easier on this screen. (Works like Shortyz 1)</li>
<li>No Download Messages: Prevents a notification from being sent for each new puzzle downloaded.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Other fixes: 
<ul>
<li>"Show Errors" now switches to "Hide Errors" when toggling. </li>
<li>Taping a box in Clues list works, also the scroll position is reset when you move 
from clue to clue, preventing long clues from "breaking" the display.</li>
<li> When "re-downloading" a New York Times puzzle updates the answer key. </li>
<li>Fixed problem of archived puzzles being 
re-downloaded. </li>
<li>Also, work has been done on managing the
on-screen keyboard to make it feel more natural.</li>
</ul>
</p>
