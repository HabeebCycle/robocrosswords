<h2>Puzzle Scraping (Experimental)</h2>

<p>Puzzle sources in this category do not come from an organized puzzle feed, but
instead are "Screen Scraped" from a web page. This means that there is not a specific
date associated with them, but the puzzles will be downloaded as they are first seen.
</p>

<p>This means that you might see a number of puzzles downloaded the first time the
page is checked for puzzle links. Other puzzles with be downloaded each time you
initiate a check for puzzles, so the date you see in Shortyz may not match the actual
date the puzzle was initially published.</p>

<p>This is an experimental feature right now. In the future, I hope to offer you
the ability to set up your own custom scrapes as well, but I want to start with 
a limited test set.<p>
