<h2>Puzzle Scraping (Experimental)</h2>

<p>Puzzle sources in this category do not come from an organized puzzle feed, but
instead are "Screen Scraped" from a web page. This means that there is not a specific
date associated with them, but the puzzles will be downloaded as they are first seen.
</p>

<p>It also means you might see a number of puzzles downloaded the first time the
page is checked for puzzle links. Other puzzles with be downloaded each time you
initiate a check for puzzles, so the date you see in Shortyz may not match the actual
date the puzzle was initially published.</p>

<p><b>Cru Cryptics/Kegler's Kryptics</b> The Cru Cryptics and Kegler's Kryptics archives 
contain a ton of puzzles. If you enable
this source, Shortyz will download three new puzzles from each of them every time you start a download. This
is likely best used with the auto-download feature turned off.</p>

<p>This is an experimental feature right now. In the future, I hope to offer you
the ability to set up your own custom scrapes as well, but I want to start with 
a limited test set.<p>
