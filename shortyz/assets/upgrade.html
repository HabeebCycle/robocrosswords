<h2>Welcome to Shortyz 2.0</h2>
<p>While on the surface 2.0 will seem familiar to users of the 1.x versions, this 
is almost a complete rewrite of the application. Some quick 
notes on things that have changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Download Puzzles" menu item is now on the Puzzle Select screen.</li>
<li>You can "Long Touch" a puzzle to archive or delete it.</li>
<li>You can have the "Cleanup" operation delete, rather than archive puzzles as an option in the settings.</li>
<li>The play board is all new. Scrolling is improved as is movement. You can also "Long Touch"
the play board to zoom in and out.</li>
<li>Popup will tell you when you have completed a puzzle</li>
<li>The Puzzle Info screen shows you the time you have spent playing a puzzle</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Please Note:</b> You will not be able to continue puzzles you started with 1.x in the 2.0
version. There is a completely new file format which is not backwards compatible. I do,
however, promise this will be the last time this happens. On the up side, the new file
format is much much faster than the old one, so people on older phones should not see the 
occasional loss of answers.</p>


<p>Thanks to everyone using Shortyz. The first version was literally a weekend project for me
and was definitely rough around the edges. While I make no claims that this version is 
perfect, it is a much better base to improve upon. Coming soon: multi-touch zoom control 
for Android 2.0+ users</p>
